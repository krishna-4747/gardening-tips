<h3>1.Watering:</h3>
Thanks to its Mediterranean ancestry, English lavender is drought tolerant once established and only needs supplemental 
watering during prolonged dry spells. However, new plants should be watered regularly (every other day for the first week after planting, 
then once or twice a week until roots become established). Depending on your location, lavender may require some watering 
during winter, especially if in containers.

<h3>Tip:</h3> Watering English lavender too frequently can cause root and crown rot and is the most common reason plants die. For established plants, it’s best to err on the side of underwatering rather than overwatering.

<h3>2.Amendments and fertilizer:</h3>
Do not use any amendments, especially compost or other organic matter when planting. Plants grown in poor, sandy, 
or rocky soils will be healthier and longer-lived than those grown in humus-rich soil. Feeding is generally not necessary. 
Over-fertilized plants will often produce fewer flowers.

<h3>3.Pruning and deadheading:</h3>
Prune lavender back by 1/3 to 1/2 its height in spring after new leaves emerge to stimulate growth and keep plants from 
looking scraggly. Make the cuts just above the new leaf growth rather than cutting into the woody base, since lavender 
will not grow back from old wood. (The exception is dead or damaged stems, which should be removed right down to the base of 
the plant). Another light pruning in midsummer, right after the first flush of blooms, will often encourage repeat flowering.

<h3>4.Overwintering:</h3>
In climates where temperatures dip below zero degrees Fahrenheit, insulate your plants with a winter mulch of evergreen 
boughs, shredded leaves, or straw, especially if there’s a lack of snow cover. Proper soil drainage is also essential to 
plant survival in areas with cold, damp winters.

<h3>5.Propagation:</h3>
From stem cuttings taken from new growth in early summer.

<h3>6.Pests and diseases:</h3>
Lavender has few pest or disease problems, but is susceptible to Phytophthora root and crown rot, 
particularly if the soil around the base of the plant remains wet for long periods of time. Septoria leaf spot,
a fungal disease that infects the surface tissues of the plant's leaves, can also be a problem. The best control 
measures are to avoid overhead watering and provide good air circulation around your plants.
