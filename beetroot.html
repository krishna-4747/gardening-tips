<h3>1.Select either seeds or seedlings:</h3>
 These should be readily available from your local nursery or garden center. Don't shy away from seeds – beetroot 
 is notoriously easy to take care of.
The "Boltardy" variety of beetroot is best if you're sowing early. White and golden varieties take about half as long 
to grow and don't bleed in salads (the downside being they don't have that beautiful carmine color). Apart from these 
things, the variety you choose will depend on the look and flavor that appeals to you most

<h3>2.Know that you can also grow beetroot in pots:</h3>
If you're dealing with the round variety (which you probably are – the long, cylindrical varieties are rarely grown), 
a pot can work just as well, so long as it's at least 20cm (8in) in diameter and at least 20cm (8in) deep.

<h3>3. Till the soil to prepare it.:</h3>
Remove weeds and any other debris, as well as any stones that might impede root growth. The soil only needs tilling to 
one spade blade of depth. Roughly level the area and rake over the top to loosen.
If you have heavy soil, it's best prepared in late autumn. If it's lighter, aim for early spring.[2] If you're planting 
in autumn, leave the top of the soil rough so the winter weather can break it down.
In the northern hemisphere, sow seeds after the last frost. In the southern hemisphere, sow seeds from September through 
February.

<h3>4.Sow the seeds or plant the seedlings:</h3>
Sow your beetroot seeds 2cm (3/4"-1") deep. Keep seeds or seedlings apart at a distance of at least 10 to 15cm (4-6"). 
It'll be easiest to plant them in rows.
If you're succession planting, sow beetroot every 14 days for a continuous harvest. This is an easy alternative to 
succession harvesting.

<h3>5.Water daily until the leaves begin to sprout:</h3>
 At the beginning, your seeds need plenty of water to start the germination process. The roots will take moisture from 
 the soil once they're established.
That being said, avoid over-watering. This causes beetroot to produce more leaves and less root, risking them "bolting" 
(flowering and not producing a vegetable). What's more, under-watering creates woody roots.
Once you have sprouts, only water them every 10-14 days in dry spells.[3] Other than when the weather is unnaturally dry, 
normal rainfall should be fine.

<h3>6.Thin them out:</h3>
Once your beetroots have about 2cm (1 inch) of leaves sprouting, cut the weakest seedlings until the remaining plants 
are at least 10 cm (4 inches) apart.[4] Do not pull them by hand, since this could disturb the roots of neighbouring plants.
Some people recommend a bit more space than 10 cm. If you have the space, you may want to be a bit more generous

<h3>7.Fertilise your plants</h3>
Add 4–6 liters (1.1–1.6 US gal) of complete organic fertiliser per 10 square metres of bed. Add a thin layer of compost or 
well-rotted manure. You may also want to use 30g of high nitrogen fertiliser per square metre if your plants aren't growing well.
Applying too much nitrogen can cause lots of leafy growth and little root development. If you notice large leaves and smaller 
roots, reduce fertiliser applications or switch to a fertiliser with lower nitrogen levels.

<h3>8.Watch out for birds and weeds:</h3>
 Depending on your area, you may need to devise some sort of cover for your plants to keep them away from animals. 
 As for weeds, you'll have to take care of those by hand. As soon as you see one cropping up, get rid of it. However, be 
 careful weeding. Avoid using hoes or other sharp objects near the roots or you might cut them. Hand weeding is best.
