vermiculite. The ideal pH level of banana plant soil should be between 5.6-6.5(approx).

<h3>How to Grow Banana Tree at Home From Seeds</h3>

and the embryo will sprout out quickly.
2. Fill the container with potting mix soil. Sow the banana seeds 1‚ÅÑ4 inch deep and then backfill with compost. 
Water the seed until the soil is moist and maintain damp conditions.
3. For germination, maintain the temperature of at least 60 degrees F (15 C).
4. As seeds germinate, carefully lift it from the pot ensuring that the juvenile roots do not get damaged, and 
repot it in a large container with free-draining, good quality compost.
5. The time seeds take to germinate depends on the banana variety. It can take anything between 2-3 weeks to 2-3 months.

<h3>Care Requirements For Banana Plant At Home</h3>
1. Banana trees are natives of tropical and subtropical regions. Place the banana container in a spot that receives 
sun most of the day. Bananas love sun, humidity, and heat.
2. Keep it sheltered from the winds, and cold weather.
3. Keep the soil moist all the time. In summers, watering may be required twice a day. In winters, reduce the watering. 
And when you water it thoroughly, allow it to drain for some time.
4. Bring the banana plant indoors when the outside temperature falls below 57 degrees F (14 C). Your banana tree will start 
dying at 50 degrees F (10 C).
5. Fertilize the young plant with a nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Once mature, fertilize it regularly.
6. Remove old leaves from the base of the banana plant.
7. Keep a check! Yellow leaves indicate a lack of nutrients while brown or dry leaves are a sign of overwatering.
