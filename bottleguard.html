<h3>How to grow bottle gourd from seed:</h3>
1.It is easy to grow bottle gourd by seed sowing method throughout the year. 
  Summer and monsoon are the best time to plant seeds. Buy bottle gourd seeds online.
2.Seeds are sown directly in small pits or on raised beds which germinate in 7-8 days.
3.Bottle gourd seedlings are very fast-growing and quickly form the habit of a climber.
4.Strong trellis support should be built for the climber to grow. Many gardeners let 
  the plant trail on the ground or allow it to climb on poles or roof of the house.
5.Pinch off growing points of the young plant to induce branching.
6.The side shoots will develop separate male and female flowers in the second month.
7.After pollination, the female flowers have little gourds beneath them. If male flowers 
  are plentiful, some of them can be removed.

<h3>How to grow bottle gourd in pots:</h3>
Bottle gourds can be easily grown in 14-inch containers or big sized grow bags. Add good quality 
potting mixture in the container before planting seeds. The organic veggie mix is one of the 
best suited growing media for bottle gourds. Grow one plant per container.

<h3>Bottle gourd plant care:</h3>
1.Bottle gourd should be grown in open and sunny locations.
2.Top dress the plant with a thick layer of coco peat and well-rotted manure in equal parts. 
  Repeat this 2-3 times during the growing season.
3.Bottle gourd plant requires plenty of watering for growth. It requires abundant moisture all the time.
4.Continuous stopping and pinching of climber ensures very faithful and sharply plant.

<h3>Bottle gourd plant troubleshoots:</h3>
1.Immature gourds are falling: A very common trouble. Baby gourds remain at a standstill, eventually 
  shrivelled up and fall off. Usually, this is due to lack of sufficient nourishment or watering. Supply 
  liquid manure and let it reach right down to the roots.
2.Small fruits are rotting: Gourds when quite small, turn yellow, rot at the end and eventually fall off. 
  This may be due to waterlogging or imperfect pollination.

<h3>Harvesting bottle gourds:</h3>
1.The harvesting season begins after 2-3 months of seed sowing, and it continues for about 6-8 weeks.
2.Best stage to harvest is when fruits have soft, smooth surface and you can push your finger nail 
  through the skin or scrape it easily.
