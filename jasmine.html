            <h3>1.Provide stakes for climbing jasmine:</h3> 
            Many varieties of jasmine require stakes to climb in order to grow strong and healthy. Place a tall stake 
            or a trellis a few inches from the base of the jasmine, and gently wrap it around the stake as it grows. 
            Eventually, it will begin growing up the stake on its own. If you planted the jasmine next to a wall or fence, 
            train it to grow upward until it begins growing on its own.
                
            <h3>2.Keep the environment moist:</h3>
            Water the soil around the jasmine throughout the growing season to keep it moist, but not soggy. A good 
            rule of thumb for determining when the water jasmine is to water when the soil begins to look and feel a 
            little dry. Use the finger test - stick your index finger 2 inches (5.1 cm) into the soil; if it’s dry, water 
            the soil. If your jasmine is in a pot, be sure it's draining adequately and water once a day.

             If your jasmine is in a pot, be sure it's draining adequately and water once a day.
                
            <h3>4.Prune the jasmine:</h3> 
            Throughout the growing season, remove dead leaves, flowers and stems by pinching them off or using hand pruners 
            to make a cut flush with the main stem of the plant. Tidy the plants by pruning stray stems. By strategically 
            removing stems here and here, you can control the shape of the vine. Shrub jasmine and varieties grown indoors 
            will need less pruning to maintain their shape.
                
            <h3> 5.Mulch the jasmine in the fall and summer:</h3>
            In order to protect the jasmine plants over the winter, add a few inches of pine straw, manure or garden 
            compost around their bases. This will ensure that the root systems don't freeze completely, and your jasmine 
            should begin growing again when the weather warms. In the summer, do the same to help conserve water and manage 
            soil temperature.
                
            <h3>6.Watch for pests:</h3>
            While jasmine generally isn't bothered by pests, it's still a good idea to watch out for certain insects that 
            might affect its growth. If you see the following insects on your jasmine, pick them off by hand and place them 
            in a jar of soapy water, or wash the leaves of the jasmine with a soapy water solution.[8] You can also use a 
            solution of water and neem oil:
            i)Aphids
            ii)Mealybugs
            iii)Red spider mite
            iv)Soft scales
      
            <h3>7.Bring back blooms:</h3>
            If your jasmine plant has bushy green growth but no blossoms, you may have too much nitrogen in your soil, which 
            often happens due to over-fertilizing. Alternatively, your plant may be stressed due to issues like over- or 
            under-watering, extreme temperatures, insufficient light, or stagnant air.
