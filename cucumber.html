<h3>1. Plant Seeds, Not Transplants – How To Grow Your Best Crop Of Cucumbers Ever!</h3>
Although you can grow cucumbers from transplants, it is far better to grow them from seed. Cucumbers are one of the 
fastest vegetable plant growers of all. By planting from seed, they never have to go through the shock of transplanting 
or get acclimated to big weather changes or conditions.

<h3>2. Crop Rotation</h3>
Cucumbers are highly susceptible to attacks from both pests and disease. Unfortunately, 
when you grow your plants in the same identical space year after year, both can already be present 
in the soil and ready to attack.

<h3>3. Plant With The Morning Sun In Mind – How To Grow Your Best Crop Of Cucumbers Ever!</h3>
If there is one thing you can do to give your plants a chance to stave off health issues and produce better – it’s to 
plant them with the morning sunlight in mind.First and foremost, cucumbers need a lot of sunlight to produce well. 
The plant relies heavily on photosynthesis to build strong, sturdy and productive vines. Photosynthesis needs sunlight 
to work. To allow that to happen, always locate your crop in an area that receives a minimum of six to eight hours of 
sunlight each day.

<h3>4. Provide Your Plants With Great Soil – How To Grow Your Best Crop Of Cucumbers Ever!</h3>
Whether planted in the ground or in containers, cucumbers need rich, fertile soil to grow strong and thrive. 
In addition, that soil needs to be light, airy and drain well. This helps seeds germinate quick, and powers early growth.

<h3>5. Elevate The Soil Where You Plant – How To Grow Your Best Crop Of Cucumbers Ever!</h3>
Cucumber plants are highly susceptible to rot. But a bit of “raised planting” will help keep the main plant stem out 
of sitting water during heavy rains or watering.
For garden planting, create tapered mounds approximately 18 inches in diameter that are 3 to 4 inches high in the 
middle. And remember – add in compost and worm castings to the mounds when planting.= to energize the soil even more!

<h3>6. Fertilize Lightly, But Often – How To Grow Your Best Crop Of Cucumbers Ever!</h3>
Finally, fertilizing is a must! Even with the best power in the soil, your cucumber plants will need more energy to 
really bloom and produce. But how you give your plants that power will make a huge difference in their performance.
Cucumber plants need to be fed low, slow and consistently. Instead of fertilizing your plants one or two times with a 
big dose of nutrients, give them regular but lighter feedings every 10 to 14 days as they mature. The best way to do 
this is with a liquid fertilizer, compost tea, or worm casting tea.
