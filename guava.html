<h3>1.Dig a hole about 2 feet (0.61 m) deep:</h3>
 Remove rocks or other debris you come across while digging. Once you have your hole, loosen the soil 
 a bit at the bottom with the tool you used to dig it.If using a pot, make sure it too is at least 2 
 feet (0.61 m) feet deep.

<h3>2.Fill the hole around the tree or seed:</h3>
Don’t compact the soil after you fill the hole, keep it loose. You want to make sure that your tree has 
room to spread its roots and grow with little resistance.For cuttings, take care that no roots are above 
the soil and that the graft line is. Cut off any roots above the graft line if necessary.Get low to the 
ground to make sure your cuttings are completely vertical once planted.Mark where you’ve placed seeds with 
little flags that can be easily removed once the seed has sprouted.

<h3>3.Water your tree:</h3>
While the tree is young, you should water it 2 to 3 times a week. Once it matures, however, it won’t need as 
much water so 2 to 3 times a month should suffice. Guava trees are sensitive to waterlogging, so be sure to 
regulate what you give.Guava trees are mainly rain-fed.
Remove any weeds and grass from the tree’s area as a young guava tree cannot compete very well 
against them for water and nutrients.

<h3>4.Fertilize the tree once every three months with organic fertilizer:</h3>
Your tree should be well established before performing this step. Scatter the fertilizer around the tree while 
making sure not to come in contact with the stem. Once you've done that, water the tree and fertilizer thoroughly.

<h3>5.Prune your guava tree to give it a tree shape:</h3> 
You'll want to start pruning around 3 to 4 months after the tree has sprouted. If your tree has multiple trunks, 
find the middlemost one and cut the others away at their base. Trim up the side branches to keep them around 2 
feet (0.61 m) to 3 feet (0.91 m) in length. Cut any branches that sprout from other branches and any dead or damaged 
branches you find as well.

<h3>6.Check your tree for diseases:</h3>
Common diseases to look out for are the Guava Wilt Disease, Stylar End Rot, and Anthracnose.

<h3>7.Pick your guava fruit:</h3>
That's it, you've grown your guava tree. You'll know when your fruit is ripe and mature enough to pick by the change of 
both its color and texture. Color will change from green to yellow, and then the fruit will soften.
