<h3>1. Feed Flowers</h3>

At least three fertilizer applications is needed for roses that bloom throughout the growing season. 
The first application should be done when the plants break out of winter, then two more in mid-June and July to keep the flowers growing. 
Use a balanced fertilizer and other mulches, such as compost or rotted manure, to help roses get additional nutrients.  

<h3>2. Water</h3>

All plants need some amount of water to grow. Check the soil to see if it is moist and consider the weather conditions recently.
Apply water directly to the soil using a soaker hose or through drip irrigation if the soil seems too dry.

<h3>3. Regular Pruning</h3>

This is something that should be done in early spring and will help to continue to produce flowers throughout the season.
First, pull off all the leaves and use your pruning shears to trim the horizontal canes that are growing into the center of the plant,
around, or anything crossing the plant. This will allow an open center and decrease friction of the branches and blooms.
Next, remove any branches that are diseased or dead. Cut back the vertical canes to an outward facing bud, making the cut about a
half inch above that bud at a 45-degree angle and away from the bud.

<h3>4. Regular Inspections</h3>

Check on your roses to catch early signs of disease outbreaks or pests. 
This will allow for your roses to have much higher longevity.  

<h3>5. Mulch</h3>

Add course, organic mulch around your roses in about a 2-3 inch layer. 
The coarseness of the mulch helps to reduce disease on the leaves of the roses since it decreases the amount of water 
that splashes onto them.

<h3>6. Soil</h3>

Plant roses in a soil that allows drainage. If there is poor drainage, it will drown your roses and allow little to no breathing room. 
Mix organic matter such as compost with excavated soil to use as backfill for the planting hole.  

<h3>7. Site</h3>

The location where you plant your roses is equally as important as caring for them afterward. 
Make sure your roses are in an area that provides at least six hours of sun each day. 
If your roses are in the shade, they will be prone to diseases and other harmful conditions.   

<h3>8. Plant Reblooming Roses</h3>

If you want roses that continue to bloom throughout the growing season, make sure to pick up Bright Melody, 
Fairy Moss and Knock Out roses. These are a few types of roses that will more readily rebloom.

<h3>9. Egg Shells</h3>

Egg shells are rich in calcium. This strengthens the tissue of a rose allowing for healthier blooms. 
Mix in crushed up shells into potting soil and add it to your potted roses or crush the shells and sprinkle 
them on the top layer of soil around the rose. The finer the shell is crushed, the faster it has the ability 
to release calcium into the soil.    

<h3>10. Coffee Grounds</h3>

Coffee grounds contain nitrogen which helps roses. Sprinkle some to the base of the rose or add some to a 
compost pile to help enrich the soil. Beware of adding too much because it will, unfortunately, hurt your roses.
Just remember that a little goes a long way.

<h3>11. Insect Control</h3>

Using a systemic pesticide like acephate does its job in protecting the growth of your roses from mites, 
whiteflies, aphids and other pests. If your rose bush is adjacent to a vegetable garden, organic options 
like neem oil and insecticidal soap will be better.

<h3>12. Nurse Roots</h3>

Plants absorb nutrients and water from its roots, so do your best to tend for them. 
If you are going to dig around the soil of your roses be sure to not cut or damage the roots since a damaged plant 
will have a high risk of dying or may have a long recovery time.  

<h3>13. Classical Music</h3>

Although this is not proven science, some gardeners truly believe that playing music helps plants grow 
from their response to the vibrations of the musical notes.
