<h3>1.Prep Your Soil</h3>
Soil preparation is crucial to the health of blueberry plants. Blueberries prefer acidic soil, and if the soil in your 
area is not acidic enough, you may need to make adjustments, with guidance from your local garden center or Cooperative 
Extension. Planning ahead is crucial – if changes in your soil’s pH levels are necessary, it’s best to make them a year 
before you plant your blueberries. 


<h3>2.Space and Plant Your Blueberries</h3>
It’s time to get your plants in the ground! In most areas, it’s ideal to plant blueberries in the fall or spring. 
You can plant blueberry bushes as close as 2 or 2.5 feet apart to form solid hedgerows, or space them up to 6 feet apart 
so they grow individually. If you plant in rows, allow 8 to 10 feet between the rows.

<h3>3.Fertilize Your Blueberry Plants</h3>
Blueberries are part of a plant family that includes the flowering azalea, mountain laurel and heather-plants. You can ask 
your local garden center for fertilizer recommendations, but once established, blueberry plants typically respond well to acid 
fertilizers such as azalea or rhododendron formulations. Follow the instructions on the label carefully – blueberries are 
sensitive to overfertilization! You’ll want to apply fertilizer one month after planting, not at the time of planting. For 
best results, fertilize your plants once in early spring and again in late spring, always watering thoroughly afterward.

<h3>4.Mulch Your Blueberry Plants</h3>
Blueberries do best with 2-4 inches of mulch over the roots to conserve moisture, prevent weeds and add organic matter. 
Bark mulch, acid compost, sawdust and grass clippings all work well.
