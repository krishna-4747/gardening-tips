around six hours of sunshine, and it will grow well.

<h3>2.The right temperature to grow hibiscus</h3>
The temperatures you grow your hibiscus in actually matters a lot as they are used to a particular set of 
conditions.
Temperatures ranging between 60°F – 90°F or 16°C – 32°C are most optimum for the hibiscus, anything lower than 
that and your plant will not survive. So, bring it indoors during the winter!

<h3>3.How to water Hibiscus Plant?</h3>
What you need to keep in mind while watering your hibiscus are the weather and the flowering cycle. In the 
flowering stage, the hibiscus requires more water. During summers as well, it needs a fair bit of watering but not 
too much so as to drown the plant.

<h3>4.How to fertilize?</h3>
Just like any other plant, the hibiscus needs a large volume of nutrition in the growing stage. March to October 
is the crucial period, and this is when you should be using your fertilizer.
You can either add high potassium compost to the soil, use liquid fertilizer or a slow-release fertilizer. Iron and 
magnesium too are essential for plant growth. However, in the winter, there’s no need to fertilize.

<h3>5.Pruning your hibiscus</h3>
The main aim behind pruning is to ensure that you’re getting a beautiful hibiscus for your garden. So, cut around 
one-third of the longer branches and remove any dead, weak or oddly shaped branches.

<h3>6.ackling pests and diseases</h3>
Deal with aphids and scales before they spread by pruning any and all infected branches as soon as you can and 
treating the plant with insecticidal oil.
Spider mites are common hibiscus pests, and you can deal with them by showering your plant in lukewarm water.
