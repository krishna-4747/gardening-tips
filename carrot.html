                <h3>Carrot Growing Tip #1:</h3>
                Looking back, my son most likely forgot what we had even planted as carrot seeds seem to take forever 
                to germinate (sometimes 15-17 days). Some gardeners claim that baby carrot tops show up in a week when 
                directly sown into the garden.
                <h3>Carrot Growing Tip #2:</h3>
                The trick to making sure that the carrot seeds germinate at all is to keep them moist after their planted. 
                I didn’t say make them moist, I said keep them moist. Don’t get those teeny-tiny seeds all wet on day one 
                just to let them dehydrate on day three and then water them on day six, etc. No bueno. Water them everyday 
                until they rear their teeny little heads if you have to.
                <h3>Carrot Growing Tip #3:</h3> 
                Plant them in loose, friable soil. Loose and friable soil looks rich, crumbly, and fluffy. Hard, compacted 
                soils don’t leave room for good root development, which is, after all the part that we’re after in the first 
                place. Containers and raised garden beds are great for growing carrots because we typically the add soil mix 
                ourselves. If you have decent soil that’s on the clay-ish side, plant a ball variety that doesn’t need a lot of 
                soil depth such as ‘Romeo’ ‘Golden Ball’ or ‘Oxheart.’
                <h3>Carrot Growing Tip #4:</h3>
                Once the little carrot greens are a couple of inches tall, do them a favor and thin them out. Using a small pair 
                of scissors, just snip off some heads until they’re spaced 2″ or more apart from each other. You’re going to fight 
                it, but it needs to be done.
                <h3>Carrot Growing Tip #5:</h3>
                This is not a hard-and-fast rule, but I always start my carrot seeds directly into the garden bed outdoors. 
                They really aren’t thrilled about having their roots disturbed while they’re trying to get a grip on growing. 
                This isn’t to ssay that some people don’t start them indoors and transplant them successfully. But it’s extremely 
                hard to place the miniscule seeds far enough apart so that you’re not untangling roots during transplanting. It’s 
                all just a tedious task in my opinion. So I plant the seeds where they’ll grow until harvest day.
