<h3>1. Aim For 7–8 Hours of Direct Sun</h3>
Tomato plants love the sun, so you all get the best results by growing them somewhere with as much direct sunlight as possible. 
While tomato plants can survive on 6 hours of direct sun per day, they will be happiest with 7–8 hours. 
Pick the brightest spot in your yard, and make sure it isn’t shaded for half the day by any trees, fences, or buildings. 
Don’t forget to use some stakes or tomato cages to keep your plants upright and facing the sun. 

 
<h3>2. Test and Amend Your Soil</h3>
If you are growing tomatoes in containers, we assure you that your potting soil is healthy and balanced if you buy it new 
from Eising. However, if you’re planting them in your garden bed, that soil might require some amendments after the long 
winter and last year’s growing season. A soil test will help you determine if any nutrients are lacking or if the pH level 
is slightly off. Slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6.5–6.8 is ideal!

 
<h3>3. Add Quality Vegetable Fertilizer</h3>
When tomato plants are growing at such impressive speeds, it makes sense that they need a lot of fuel to keep them going! 
Use a water-soluble fertilizer that is specifically formulated for tomatoes for your best chance at success. If your soil 
test identified sub-par nutrient levels, you could buy a formula that’s fortified with those necessary nutrients. Apply it 
once per week, and also consider using a transplant fertilizer to help ease the transition into the ground. 


<h3>4. Water Tomatoes Generously and Consistently</h3>
If you want big, juicy tomatoes, your plants are going to need a lot of water! However, consistency is key to getting the best 
results. If you aren’t consistent with the timing and the amount you’re watering, the skins of your tomatoes will split or 
possibly develop blossom end rot. We suggest evening watering every other night, depending on the weather. 
Drip irrigation systems or soaker hoses are ideal for delivering consistent moisture to your plants without overdoing it. 
Remember, always water your tomatoes at the soil level; this strengthens the root system and avoids foliage disease.

 
<h3>5. Use Mulch</h3>
Spread a layer of mulch across the soil surface to prevent soil moisture from evaporating under the sun too quickly. Use a 
natural mulch that’s free from artificial dyes, like shredded bark or mulched leaves. Mulch will also help to block weeds from 
germinating, and weeds can end up stealing a lot of soil nutrients away from your growing veggie plants. 

 
<h3>6. Prune The Tomato Suckers</h3>
Curious about the secret to get your tomatoes growing faster? The secret is pruning suckers! As your tomato plants grow, 
you’ll see new little stems sprouting out from the spot where larger branches connect to the main stem. These “suckers” actually 
drain a lot of energy from your plant. Pinch them off with your thumb and forefinger, allowing your plant to devote more energy 
to growing amazing tomatoes––faster!
