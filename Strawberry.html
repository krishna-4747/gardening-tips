<h3>1.Selecting a Planting Site:</h3>
Choose a sunny and well-drained area in loamy, sandy, or clay soil that is acidic to slightly alkaline. 
The tree can tolerate a site with some shade. Once the tree is established, it can tolerate drought and 
some wind, but it will not withstand severe conditions, especially when it is young. A strawberry tree 
can do well despite the presence of salt runoff or salt spray. This strawberry tree can also thrive when 
planted in urban areas and along streets and highways.

<h3>2.Spacing, Depth, and Support:</h3>
If you plan to plant numerous trees or create a hedge with the strawberry tree, plant them 20 to 35 feet 
apart because the Arbutus unedo is considered to be small to medium in size depending on the cultivar you select. 
Younger trees may need a stake for support until they become more mature and hardy.

<h3>3.Light:</h3>
The strawberry tree appreciates more sun than shade. It will thrive if it has 6 hours of full, direct sun a day.

<h3>4.Soil:</h3>
Like other ericaceous plants, this tree does best in acidic soil. It can also tolerate a neutral pH. You can make your 
soil more acidic as needed.

<h3>5.Water:</h3>
It is important to water regularly for the first year so that the tree can form strong roots. The strawberry tree is known 
to become more drought-resistant as it matures, and it can even grow in salty areas. Plan on 1 inch of water each week to 
equal the number of inches in the trunk's diameter.

<h3>6.Temperature and Humidity:</h3>
Strawberry trees are hardy in zones 7 and above and most humidity levels. However, the tree will not thrive in excessively 
humid areas.

<h3>7.Fertilizer:</h3>
Add about 3 inches of organic mulch around the base of the tree in the summer to protect it from scorching sunlight and in 
the winter to protect it from frost. This will also serve as an organic, slow-release fertilizer.
